/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = 'Git is a program used to keep track of files/folders. Version control being a large aspect.'

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitHubDefinition = 'GitHub is a website that hosts your file/folders/versions so that they can be shared with others. An online presence for Git, in a way.'

//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let init = {
    description: 'Initializes the current folder for use as a git repository. First step.',
    code: 'git init'
}
//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'clone' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the clone command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let clone = {
    description: 'Takes the current repository and copies it to a new folder',
    code: 'git clone'
}

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'status' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the status command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let status = {
    description: 'Returns the status of the files in the repository. Red File Name = not added; Green File Name = Added. Also shows how many commits ahead of the GitHub repository',
    code: 'git status'
}

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let add = {
    description: 'Adds a file from the folder to the git repository. Needs to be done before file can be committed.',
    code: 'git add <file name or ".">'
}

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the commit command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let commit = {
    description: 'Creates a version of all added files in current folder.',
    code: 'git commit <-m "commit message">'
}

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'push' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the push command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let push = {
    description: 'sends the commited file versions to GitHub',
    code: 'git push'
}

let gitObjects = [init, clone, status, add, commit, push];
